# cosc310-LinkedList

This project involves implementing a doubly linked circular list from an interface.
It is then applyed to a company e.g. (a company may have many departments and within those departments there are employees).
Instead of using a traditional way to store information such as an array, the linkedlist will be used to store information for a company.
